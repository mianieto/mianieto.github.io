I'm terrible at controlling actual claw machines, so I coded my own. You can move the claw by holding down the button, and stop by releasing. The main challenge was to chain the animation required to move the claw and the arm. To simulate gravity, the toy tilts based on which part of the toy the claw grabs. The facial expression on the toys and the claw is also animated for fun.
